# ZIRCONIUM
Final year project for software development developed by Group 4.

1. Step 1 Pull the Zirconium Project
Pull the repository by using github desktop into your localhost(xampp) htdocs folder.

2. Step 2 Composer
Downloading Composer;
- "https://getcomposer.org/Composer-Setup.exe" Copy this link and run it on your local browser.
- Download the setup.exe and put it anywhere on your windows directory.
- Run the setup.exe
- Select "install for all users (recommended)"
- "Yes" to allow this app to make changes.
- On installation options, make sure developer mode is (UNCHECKED) then click next.
- Select "browse" to select your xampp (php.exe)

    SIDE NOTE
    Where to find php.exe?
    i.    Find the folder where you downloaded xampp with.
    ii.   Open from Xampp -> php folder.
    iii.  Select php.exe
    
- On proxy settings, make sure you leave everything and click next.
- Click Install.
- Click Next and Finish.

Next step is to enable your composer;
- Open command prompt (cmd)
- Direct it to your xampp folder.

    SIDE NOTE USING THE TERMINAL
    i.  Use cd command to nagivate
    ii.   "cd /" is to nagivate to root directory.
    iii.  "cd ~" to nagivate your home directory.
    iv.   "cd .." to nagivate up one directory level.
    v.    "cd -" to go back to previous directory.
    vi.   "dir" to see all the current files and folders in your current directory.

- Type "cd /"
- Make sure your xampp folder is in the correct drive! Ex: My xampp folder in in "D:" drive. Therefore i will type "D:".
- Once your directory looks like this Ex: "D:\Xampp"
